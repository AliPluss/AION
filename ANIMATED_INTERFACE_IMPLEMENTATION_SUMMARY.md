## üéØ Key Features Delivered

### 1. Dynamic Icon System
Every selectable element now has animated icons with unique visual effects that enhance user experience without compromising terminal performance.

### 2. Real-time Navigation
Arrow key navigation with live highlighting provides immediate visual feedback, making the interface feel responsive and modern.

### 3. Cultural Sensitivity
Language selection uses appropriate cultural flags with respectful animations that reflect the cultural context.

### 4. Security Visualization
Security levels are immediately recognizable through color-coded icons with appropriate animation intensity.

### 5. Performance Optimization
All animations are optimized for terminal environments with caching and efficient frame calculations.

### 6. Accessibility
ASCII fallback ensures the interface remains functional on all terminal types, from basic command prompts to advanced terminal emulators.
